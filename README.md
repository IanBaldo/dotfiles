# Simple Scripts to Setup NVIM the way I like it

This repo was built to facilitate the installation and configuration of some of the programs I like to use to work and configure nvim to work as a fully feature IDE.

Simply run the command below to run the script and install everything
'''bash
bash setup.sh
'''

## What will this install on my machine? (not necessarily in this order)
+ neovim
+ git
+ curl
+ chromium-browser
+ python3-dev and cmake (dependencies from YCM Plugin)
+ Plug (Plugin manager for VIM)

## List of Plugins
+ vim-man
+ undotree
+ gruvbox (colortheme)
+ lightline
+ fzf
+ nerdtree
+ vim-multiple-cursors
+ YouCompleteMe (YCM)

### Notice

There also some custom aliases that I like and just a few key remaps for the fzf plugin.

These are not optional yet. But are easy enough to remove...
